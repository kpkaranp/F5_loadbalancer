Dear ______,

I hope you're doing well. As my current contract is set to expire this month, I wanted to express my strong interest in continuing my work at AXA. I've truly enjoyed being part of the team and contributing to our projects, and I would love the opportunity to keep growing within the company.

I understand that budget constraints can be a factor, and I’m open to discussing any possible adjustments that align with AXA’s needs. My priority is to continue adding value to the team and working in this great environment.

Would you be available to discuss the possibility of extending my contract? I’d appreciate the chance to explore any options that might be available.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
